# Battleship Game

## Description

This is the popular batlleship game. The game is played against computer.
<br />
I created algorithm for computer, when it finds and hit first element of ship 
immediately search next ship elements around that first hit until doesn't sink all
ship elements.
Also I used jest library to test classes and methods created in project.
